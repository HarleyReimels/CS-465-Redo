This project used Express with HTML to build the front end, Javascript for interactivity and SPA's for faster response times by avoiding full page reloads. Express was responsible for the structure of the website, Javascript for the 
interactivity, and Angular for the SPA. MongoDB was chosen for the database for the flexibility in storing data of different types. The format is similar to JSON allowing for the ease of use for the developer. I ensured the 
API calls worked with the use of PostMan, another app that verifies API calls.
